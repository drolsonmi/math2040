## Difference of two proportions
We have two independent samples. How do we compare them? In this case, we are not comparing our sample to a null value, but to another dataset.
* $H_0:~~p_1=p_2 \qquad p_1−p_2=0$
* $H_A$:
    * Left-tailed test: $\qquad ~~p_1<p_2 \qquad p_1−p_2<0$
    * Right-tailed test: $\qquad p_1>p_2 \qquad p_1−p_2>0$
    * Two-tailed test: $\qquad~~p_1\ne p_2 \qquad p_1−p_2\ne 0$

$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$$

Steps are followed as we saw with 1 sample:
* Verify CLT is verified
* Identify null and alternate hypotheses
* Determine level of significance
* Find SE
* Perform the inference by doing either of these:
    * Find a confidence interval
    * Find a test statistic (z-score) and calculate the p-value

Confidence interval:
$$\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2 \pm z_cSE$$

### Example
A poll of 260 Utahns showed that 59.4% would vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
A poll of 425 Texans showed that 56.1% would vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

### When do we use this?
* Comparing one population to another
* Experimental studies, comparing the control group to the treatment group

## Pooled Proportions
The null hypothesis is typically $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2=0$. When this is the case, we are essentially saying the samples are part of the same population makeups. In this case, we can get a more accurate estimate of the proportion by using the __pooled proportion__.
$$\hat{p}_{pooled} = \frac{\text{Total number of successes in both samples}}{\text{Total of both sample sizes}}$$
$$\hat{p}_{pooled} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{\hat{p}_1n_1 + \hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$

where $x_i$ is the number of successes in sample $i$. Our Standard Error becomes,
$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{pooled}(1-\hat{p}_{pooled})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_{pooled}(1-\hat{p}_{pooled})}{n_2}} = \sqrt{\hat{p}_{pooled}(1-\hat{p}_{pooled})\left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}$$


### Example: Do Mamograms help?

|           | Died from breast cancer | Didn't die from breast cancer |
| --------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| Mammogram | 500                     | 44,425                        |
| Control   | 505                     | 44,405                        |
