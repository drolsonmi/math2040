# Lecture 2: Sampling
* Discussion of AI in statistics

## Samples
* Populations vs Samples
  * __Parameter__: Measurement of a population
  * __Statistic__: Measurement of a sample

## Randomness
* Anecdotal Evidence
> Recalling a visit to San Antonio, I was there when they had a freezing rainstorm. The temperature was below 40*F for most of the trip. So, whenever I think of San Antonio, I think of it as a cold place.
>
> At the Badger Den, you see 4 people in a row go straight for the Sandwich area. Therefore, people don't like the grill at the Badger Den.
>
> Find average running speed of Snow College students by sampling 40 football players.
* What does it mean to be random?
  * Every individual has an equal chance of being selected
* Why do samples need to be random?
  * All subgroups of the population need to be represented
  > __Question__: For the study of the average running speed of Snow College students, who is the population? What can we do to better represent the population?

## Sampling Methods
* Simple Random Sample
* Systematic Sample
* Stratified Sample
* Cluster Sample

Not-so-random Samples
* Convenience Sample
* Volunteer-response Sample

## Practice
Give students the following scenario. Discuss in groups which sampling method they would use to sample the population.
> __Problem__: Citywide Recycling Program Evaluation
>
> __Scenario__: A city government wants to evaluate the effectiveness of its residential recycling program. They aim to understand how many households participate, what materials are most commonly recycled, and what barriers prevent participation.
>
> __Objective__: Design a sampling strategy to collect data from households across the city.
>
> __Constraints__:
> * The city has 250,000 households spread across diverse neighborhoods (urban, suburban, and rural).
> * Recycling participation may vary by income level, housing type (single-family vs. apartment), and geographic location.
> * The city can only afford to survey 1,000 households.
>
> __Student Tasks__:
> 1. Identify potential sampling methods, such as:
>     * Simple random sampling
>     * Stratified sampling (e.g., by neighborhood type or income level)
>     * Cluster sampling (e.g., by postal code or block)
>     * Systematic sampling (e.g., every nth household from a city registry)
>     * Convenience sampling (e.g., surveying households that call in for recycling bins)
> 2. Evaluate the pros and cons of each method in this context.
> 3. Choose the most appropriate method and justify their choice based on:
>     * Representativeness of different household types
>     * Cost and logistical feasibility
>     * Risk of bias

Follow-up questions
* How could stratified sampling help ensure representation from both high- and low-income neighborhoods?
* What are the risks of using cluster sampling if recycling habits vary widely within clusters?
* How might systematic sampling introduce bias based on how the household data is organized?
