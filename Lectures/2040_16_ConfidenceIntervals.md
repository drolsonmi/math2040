# Lecture 16: Confidence Intervals

Remember:

## The Confidence Interval
We have a sample statistic. We also have a standard error (related to the standard deviation). How can we use this to infer information about the population?
* Margin of error:  $ME = z_c SE$
* Confidence interval: a range of numbers the population's proportion is likely to be in
$$p = \hat{p} \pm ME \qquad \hat{p} - ME \le p \le \hat{p} + ME$$

This is known as a __confidence interval__.

## Finding $z_c$
The __confidence level__ indicates how sure we are of these measurements. 
* Normal distribution - the confidence level is the area in the middle

  * The size of the tails (1-C) represents the chance that we could be wrong
  * This will be known as the level of significance when we discuss hypothesis testing
* The __critical value__ is the z-score that borders this area

### Practice
> Give everyone a small handful of beans
> * Find the proportion of beans that are white
> * Gather and submit the data (Microsoft Forms: Bean Counter)
>
> In your groups:
>   * Find the mean ($\mu_\hat{p}$) and the standard error ($SE_\hat{p}$)
>   * Find the margin of error using a 90% confidence level
>   * Find the 90% confidence level of the true proportion
> 
> Together (in Desmos: [2040-CLT](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ugpnvtiiyp))
>   * Plot each group's value and margin of error
>   * What are the mean and standard deviation? Do the match what we calculated?*
