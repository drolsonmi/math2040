Remember:

## Regression with multiple variables
With linear regression, we can get a good estimate of our y value. However, it is not perfect.
* With the Duke Forest dataset, we only got a correlation of 0.66. Why? Other variables.

Wouldn't it be nice to add these other variables into our model? We can! 

> on desmos.com/3d, look at a 3d equation like $f(x,y) = 1 + 2x + (1/3)y$
>     * The output now depends on both $x$ and $y$

A regression model with more than one variable as an input is known as __Multiple Regression__.
$$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2$$
$$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + \dots$$
