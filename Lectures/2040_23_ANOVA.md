# Lesson 36 - ANOVA

* To demonstrate what we are doing, show the variance of and between variables by showing boxplots of 1 variable by 4 categories
    * Show all with low variance and nearly the same mean
        * Null Hypothesis
    * Show again with low variance but very different means
        * High variance __between__ categories indicates categories are different - leans toward rejecting H0
        * Low variance between categories indicates categories are not different - leans toward failing to reject H0
    * Show again with high variance and very different means
        * High variance __within__ catgories indicates categories are not different - leans toward failing to reject H0
        * Low variance within categories indicates categories are more different - leans toward rejecting H0
    * Conclusion depends on both
        * To reject H0, we want both __high variance between categories__ and __low variance within categories__
        * $f_{score} = \frac{variance~between~categories}{variance~within~categories}$
