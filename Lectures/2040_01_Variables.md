## What is statistics?
* Study of how to best collect, analyze and draw conclusions from data
* Using data to describe the behavior of a population

## Nature of Data
* Observations
  * Datum: A single observation
  * Data: A collection of observations
* Tables (aka Data Matrix)


## Variables
* Variable Types
  * Quantitative vs Categorical
  * Discrete vs Continuous
  * Levels of Measurement
* Associations
  * Eye-balling a relationship/Correlation
  * Explanatory and Response Variables

## Relationship between variables
Sometimes, two variables could be related. In these cases, it is helpful to identify which of the two variables is more likely to influence the other.
* The 1st variable that influences the 2nd variable is known as an __explanatory variable__
* The 2nd variable that is influenced by the 1st variable is known as a __response variable__

For example,
> You look at students' Midterm and Final exam scores and want to see if there is a relationship between the two.
>
> Which exam is more likely to influence the other?
> * It is more likely for the midterm exam score to influence the final exam score
> * The *Explanatory Variable* is the midterm exam score
> * The *Response Variable* is the final exam score

When we display the data in a scatterplot, the explanatory variable is always put on the x-axis (as if it's the input of the function $f(x)$) and the response variable is always on the y-axis (as if it is the output of the function $y=f(x)$).
