# Lecture 11: Distributions
* __Note__: Today is the last day to take Exam 1

## Discrete vs. Continuous probabilities
* Reminder: Difference between discrete and continuous variables
* With discrete variables, we can pinpoint the probability of a specific value
  * What is the probability of randomly selecting a red book
* With continuous variables, we cannot pinpoint the probability of a specific value
  * What is the probability of randomly selecting a book with 512 pages?
  * What is the probability of randomly selecting a book with 752,500 words?
* Instead of looking at the probability of a particular value, we are looking at the probability of it being in a range
  * $$P(500\le pages \le 525) = \frac{\text{number of books between 500 and 525 pages long}}{\text{total number of books}}$$
  * $$P(\text{lower limit}\le X \le \text{upper limit}) = \frac{\text{number of subjects between upper and lower limits}}{\text{total sample size}}$$

## Probability Density Function
* [Histogram on python](./2040_11_Distributions.ipynb)
  * Temperature data
  * RH data
* Decrease bin width to see how it becomes continuous
  * number of bins = [30,60,80,120]
* Probability density function (draw the pdf line (or kde line) to show pattern)

## Normal Distributions
* Normal Distributions
* Standardizing (Z-Score)
