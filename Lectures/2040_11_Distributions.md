# Lecture 11: Distributions
* __Note__: Today is the last day to take Exam 1

Resources for this lecture:
* [Desmos: Z-score and Empirical Rule](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ca83f56b2f)

## Probability Density Function
* Histogram on desmos or python
* Decrease bin width to see how it becomes continuous
* Probability density function (draw the pdf line (or kde line) to show pattern)
* Instead of looking at the probability of a particular value, we are looking at the probability of it being in a range
  * $$P(80\le X \le 90) = \frac{\text{number of subjects between 80 and 90}}{\text{total sample size}} = \text{Area under the curve}$$

## Normal Distributions
* Normal Distributions
* Standardizing (Z-Score)
