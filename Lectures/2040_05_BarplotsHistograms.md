# Lecture 5: Barplots and Histograms

## Bargraph
Graph for Categorical Variables
* Create a table with the categories and counts of # of bedrooms in a house from duke forest dataset
* Create a bargraph

### Common problems with a bargraph
Show common mistakes: [Irizarry, *Introduction to Data Science*, Chapter 11 Data visualization principles](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/data-visualization-principles.html)
* What is wrong with pie charts?
  * "Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data."

## What is a histogram?
* Categorization of quantitative data
* Displays __Data Density__
  * Density is amount in a given volume, or in this case, quantity in a given range

## Setting up a histogram
* Getting the range
* Getting the number of bins (Power of 2's rule)
* Setting up the bins
  * bin size
  * bin limits
* Categorizing the data

## Drawing a histogram

## Skewness
* Symmetric (Normal) graphs
* Right- and left-skewed
$$\frac{\bar{x}}{{median}}\tag{Measure of Skewness}$$

* Uniform
* Bimodal
